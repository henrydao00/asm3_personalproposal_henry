					<p>A first year Science & Technology student studying at Langara college with various strong soft skills gaining from different volunteer activities and part-time job at one of the most well-known BBQ restaurants in Vancouver. As an enthusiastic and easily adapted person, I am always willing to learn new skills and never stop improving myself. </p>

						<p>As being nurtured by two wonderful persons who always teach me that I must dream big, I am now becoming a strong resilient man who is always ready to face with difficulties with the aim to achieve my goals. Although I grew up and spent all my childhood in Vietnam, I am now studying and working in Canada, a place that is half-way around the world from my home country. Living far away from home have never been easy for anyone, however, I always think that it is a chance for me to grow up and open my mind so that I can see the world in a different point of view. The more I feel home sick, the more I think I must be successful to make my family proud, therefore, I turn my weakness into my motivation, and most importantly, turn my motivation into action.</p>

						<p>I have a strong feeling for animals, especially reptile, and I have been a retile keeper for 8 years with strong knowledge and experience with a lot of species. Not many people can consider reptile as pet, but I can see the beauty in those animals that other people can not, and I believe they deserve to be taken care of just as dog or cat. I am now having a tortoise which have a long-life span, and he will be my soul mate maybe until I get old. I also love cooking and it is a way for me to release all my stress; thanks to my mom that I am now having a good hand-cooking.</p>
